  The GNU General Public License (GPL)
  .
  Version 2, June 1991
  .
  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
  .
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.
  .
  Preamble
  .
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
  most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
  authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
  covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
  .
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
  can do these things.
  .
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
  you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
  translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
  software, or if you modify it.
  .
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
  a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
  show them these terms so they know their rights.
  .
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
  offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  and/or modify the software.
  .
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
  software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
  know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
  by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
  .
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
  wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
  individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  .
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.
  .
  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  .
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
  placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
  this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
  or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
  derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
  Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
  translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
  without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
  "you".
  .
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
  this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
  not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
  constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
  running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
  .
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
  you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
  and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
  Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
  .
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  .
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
  forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
  or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
  these conditions:
  .
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  .
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
      this License.
  .
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
      you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
      most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
      of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
      not required to print an announcement.)
  .
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
  sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
  its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
  works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
  work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
  of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
  .
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
  the Program.
  .
  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
  Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
  License.
  .
  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
  Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
  2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
  .
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  .
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
  .
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)
  .
  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
  the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
  definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
  of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
  distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
  source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
  of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
  itself accompanies the executable.
  .
  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
  from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
  code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
  third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  .
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
  expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
  sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
  your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
  rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
  long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  .
  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
  or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
  accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
  any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
  do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
  the Program or works based on it.
  .
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
  copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
  rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
  third parties to this License.
  .
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
  are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
  contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
  conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
  of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
  you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  .
  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
  the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  .
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
  distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
  choice.
  .
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
  consequence of the rest of this License.
  .
  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
  copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
  such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
  of this License.
  .
  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
  spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
  or concerns.
  .
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
  version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
  that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
  choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  .
  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
  whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
  permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
  all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
  software generally.
  .
  NO WARRANTY
  .
  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
  PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
  PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
  YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  .
  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
  PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
  INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
  BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
  FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
  OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  .
  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  .
  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  .
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
  use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
  which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  .
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
  them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
  of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
  pointer to where the full notice is found.
  .
      One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
  .
      Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
  .
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
      under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
      Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
      any later version.
  .
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
      ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
      more details.
  .
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
  .
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  .
  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
  starts in an interactive mode:
  .
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
      with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
      software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
      type 'show c' for details.
  .
  The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
  called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
  .
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
  if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
  is a sample; alter the names:
  .
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
  .
      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
  .
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
  .
  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
  License instead of this License.
  .
  .
  "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL
  .
  Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are
  subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but
  only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header
  the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"
  exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
  .
      Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
      a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
      the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
  .
      As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
      permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
      executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
      and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
      choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
      the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
      module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
      you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
      the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
      so, delete this exception statement from your version.

   #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
   #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
   #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
   #
   #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
   #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
   #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
   #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially

   #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
   #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
   #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
   #
   #  NO WARRANTY
   #
   #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
   #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
   #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
   #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
   #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
   #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
   #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
   #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
   #  any right of any third party.
   #
   #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
   #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
   #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
   #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
   #
   #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
   #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
   #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
   #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
   #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
   #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
   #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
   #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
   #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
   #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
   #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
   #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
   #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
   #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
   #  production of secondary products from the program.
   #
   #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
   #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
   #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
   #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
   #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
   #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
   #  above as far as the program is concerned.

   #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
   #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
   #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
   #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
   #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
   #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
   #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
   #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
   #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
   #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
   #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
   #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

  3. Responsibilities
  -------------------
  .
  3.1. Distribution of Source Form
  .
  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
  the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
  Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
  License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
  attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
  Form.
  .
  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
  .
  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
  .
  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
      Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
      the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
      Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
      than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
  .
  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
      License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
      license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
      the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
  .
  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
  .
  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
  the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
  Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
  Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
  License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
  under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
  the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
  Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
  License(s).
  .
  3.4. Notices
  .
  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
  (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
  or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
  the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
  .
  3.5. Application of Additional Terms
  .
  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
  behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
  such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
  You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
  disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
  jurisdiction.
  .
  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
  ---------------------------------------------------
  .
  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
  statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
  the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
  describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
  be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
  Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
  or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
  recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
  .
  5. Termination
  --------------
  .
  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
  if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
  compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
  Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
  ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
  non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
  come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
  Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
  notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
  first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
  Your receipt of the notice.
  .
  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
  counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
  directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
  You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
  2.1 of this License shall terminate.
  .
  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
  end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
  have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
  prior to termination shall survive termination.

  *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

  *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
  *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
  *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

  *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
  *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

  8. Litigation
  -------------
  .
  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
  courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
  place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
  jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
  Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
  cross-claims or counter-claims.
  .
  9. Miscellaneous
  ----------------
  .
  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
  that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter

  FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one
  which fits your needs best.
  .
      The FreeType License (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is
      a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with
      the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the
      GPL version 2.
  .
      The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all
      projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license
      compatible to the GPLv2.

  Introduction
  ============
  .
    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.
  .
    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
  .
    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
  .
      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
  .
      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
  .
      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')
  .
    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
  .
  .
    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:
  .
     """
      Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """
  .
    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.
  .
  .
  Legal Terms
  ===========
  .
  0. Definitions
  --------------
  .
    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.
  .
    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.
  .
    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.
  .
    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.
  .
  1. No Warranty
  --------------
  .
    THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
    WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
    USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
  .
  2. Redistribution
  -----------------
  .
    This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
    irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
    display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
    sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
    forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
    authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
    herein, subject to the following conditions:
  .
      o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
        (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
        the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
        documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
        original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
        files.
  .
      o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
        states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
        FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
        encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
        documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
  .
    These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
    the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
    our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
    to us.
  .
  3. Advertising
  --------------
  .
    Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
    the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
    purposes without specific prior written permission.
  .
    We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
    following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
    or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
    `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
  .
    As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
    accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
    material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
    authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
    Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
    Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
    of this license.
  .

  This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
  2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this
  license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects
  that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific
  dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use".
  Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so
  as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility
  and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our
  Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site,
  including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and
